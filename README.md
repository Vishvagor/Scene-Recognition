<h1>Scene Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>

<p>This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for scene recognition, an essential task in computer vision. The projectâ€™s goal is to classify images into specific scene categories, with applications in areas like autonomous systems, surveillance, and image indexing.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a CNN-based model for accurate scene classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Utilizes a subset of the Places365 dataset, resized for efficient processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> A three-layer CNN featuring convolutional and max-pooling layers, ReLU activations, and a SoftMax output layer for multi-class classification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset for this project is a subset of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benjaminkz/places365/data">Places365 dataset</a>, containing images classified into 'amusement park,' 'mountain,' 'bridge,' and 'greenhouse' categories. Each image was resized to 3x48x48 to optimize processing efficiency.</p>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Convolution Layers:</strong> Three convolutional layers for feature extraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> ReLU for feature extraction and SoftMax for classification output.</li>
  <li><strong>Pooling:</strong> Max-pooling layers after each convolutional layer to reduce spatial dimensions.</li>
  <li><strong>Fully Connected Layer:</strong> Connects features to output layer for classification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.1.</li>
  <li><strong>Loss Function:</strong> Cross-Entropy Loss for multi-class classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Split:</strong> 80% for training, 20% for testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Batch Size:</strong> Set to 32 for efficient training.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The model is evaluated using:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The percentage of correct classifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Confusion Matrix:</strong> Shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.</li>
  <li><strong>Precision, Recall, F1-score:</strong> Performance metrics for each class.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The CNN model demonstrates effective scene classification, with detailed performance visualizations across training epochs.</p>
